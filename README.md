SleepScale, v 1.0
==========


SleepScale is a simple and light-weight simulator for studying DVFS and low-power state in processors. It provides an efficient method to determine jointly how fast the processor should run when busy and what low-power state it should use when idle for the best power efficiency under performance constraint.
